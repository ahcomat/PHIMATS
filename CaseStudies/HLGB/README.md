### Summary

This case study demonstrates how to model the effect of grain boundary character on hydrogen permeation using **PHIMATS**. The grain boundaries are represented using the double-obstacle potential from the order parameters of the phase-field method, allowing hydrogen interactions to be driven by $\nabla g(\phi)_\mathrm{HAGB}$ and $\nabla g(\phi)_\mathrm{LAGB}$.

While the simulations in that paper were conducted using **finite difference method**, this case study uses the **finite element implementation** in PHIMATS, based on the formulation developed in:

### Instructions

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-processing

Run the **`Preprocessing`** notebook:

* Loads the mesh file.
  üìå *Note:* Due to its large size, the mesh file is hosted on **Zenodo**. The notebook provides a direct download link and instructions.
* Sets up material parameters and generates the **`_in.hdf5`** input file.
* Creates the **`_out.hdf5`** file for writing the results.
* Generates **`.xdmf`** file for visualization in **ParaView (v5.9.1 recommended)**.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Compilation & Execution

**Step 1: Compile the driver code**

```sh
make
```

* This compiles the provided **`.cxx` driver** and links it with `libphimats.a`.

**Step 2: Run the simulation**

```sh
./FluxGB
```

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Post-processing

Run the **`PostProcessing`** notebook to:

* Plot **averaged** quantities, such as hydrogen concentration profiles and exit flux.
* Visualize **full-field** results, including the hydrogen flux vector field.
