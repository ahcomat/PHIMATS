## [v1.2.0] - Phase-field fracture (01-10-2025)

Implementing the geometric phase-field fracture for modeling damage evolution.  

### Backward Incompatibilities
- The `MechModel` constructor now takes an additional optional argument `const string kspType` to specify the KSP solver type used internally (e.g., `KSPPREONLY`, `KSPGMRES`). 

### Changed
- `PreProcessing` 
  - Takes new `SimulType`: `PFF`, to manage phase-field fracture simulations.
  - Plane stress is no longer accepted for plasticity models (not yet supported).
- `Models/MechModel` monitors the convergence of `SNES` solver via `Logger` class and saves it to the simulation log file.
- `Materials/Mechanics/IsoHard` 
  - Power-law hardening can calculate the passive dislocation density evolution based on KME model. As a result, KME parameters are now required in preprocessing. If dislocation evolution is not needed, set the KME parameters to zero.
  - Include new function `ReturnMapping2D_PFF` for return mapping algorithm including damage effects from PFF. 

### Added
- `Materials/PFF/PFF` phase-field fracture material. 
- `FiniteElements/PFF/Quad4PFF` quad4 element to manage phase-field fracture models. 
- `Models/PFFModel` model class to manage phase-field fracture simulations. 

## [v1.1.1] - Hydrogen-GB interactions (11-05-2025)

Implementing hydrogen interactions with high- and low-angle grain boundaries. Note that this is only for `Tri3TH` elements. 

### Changed
- `FiniteElements/Trapping/Tri3TH` implementing HLGB hydrogen interaction.

### Added
- `Materials/Trapping/TrapHLGB` material model for hydrogen interactions with high- and low-angle grain boundaries. 
- `CaseStudies/FluxGB` case study for hydrogen accumulation and flux at grain boundaries. 
- `CaseStudies/HLGB` case study for the effect of GB misorientation on hydrogen flux. 

## [v1.1.0] - Hydrogen-mechanics interactions (01-05-2025)

Including the hydrogen-mechanics interactions, i.e. hydrostatic stresses and dislocations.

### Backward Incompatibilities
- The `SimulationData` preprocessing dict now should include a constant concentration value `conB` for trapping simulations. 

### Added
- `CaseStudies/CrackTip` directory for hydrogen interactions using boundary layer model. 
- `Materials/Trapping/MechTrap` for modeling hydrogen interactions with hydrostatic stresses and dislocations. 

### Changed
- `Materials/Mechanics/IsoHard` added the `Kocks-Mecking-Estrin` hardening model based on dislocation density.
- `FiniteElements/Trapping/Quad4TH` hydrogen-mechanics interactions.
- `Models/TrappingModel` equilibrium boundary concentrations for mechanics interactions.
